          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hi! I'm Nico and I like travelling and taking pictures wherever I go.
            I grew up in Sarasota, Fl and recently moved to the mountains in between Santa Cruz and Los Gatos, Ca.
            I have been taking pictures since I was 12 years old and I have been using Fujifilm cameras since 2020.
            In my free time I am also learning how to program and build websites using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Rust, 
            this is what led me to creating this website from scratch as a side project.
            My favorite thing about Photography was always shooting and learning about film cameras.
            That is what attracted me to Fujifilm cameras, they have a lot of film simulations that make your pictures look like they were shot on film.

          </p>
